<div class="infor" style="color: white;margin-left: 100px;margin-right: 100px" >
<h5>1. Be Proud</h5>
<p>
Before diving into the practical gym tips for beginners, remember that the most important exercise catalyst is confidence. Whether you're lifting 100 pounds or 1 pound, you should be proud of yourself for showing up at the gym at all! Don't be intimidated by others or scared to ask for help.

Remember that everyone at the gym was once in your shoes. Those first few workouts, no matter how "easy" they are in terms of physical intensity, are often the most mentally challenging. Be proud, remain confident and trust that your gym skills and fitness savvy will increase over time.</p>
<h5>
2. Stay Strong</h5>
<p>
Beginners often flock to the treadmills and stationary cycles because these machines are easy for all ages and ability levels. But don't get stuck in a cardio rut â€” try incorporating at least two days of strength training into your weekly routine. If you aren't feeling ready to explore the weight room, remember that bodyweight exercises can be just as effective at building strength.

Not really sure where to start? Try one of Planet Fitness' unlimited, free fitness training sessions offered to all members through PE@PF. These small group sessions are led by certified trainers and can teach you basic weight-training and workout movements. Additionally, most Planet Fitness locations offer a 30-minute Express Circuit training option that can guide you through a full-body workout.</p>
<h5>
3. Work Hard</h5>
<p>
If you're not sweating by the end of your workout, perhaps you aren't pushing yourself hard enough. Try to reach an "out of breath" state at least once during your workout by incorporating high-intensity movements like sprinting, jumping jacks, burpees or squat jumps.</p>
