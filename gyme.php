4. Ask How</h5>
<p>
Instead of shying away from exercises or equipment you're unfamiliar with, ask a gym employee or fellow gym-goer for help. Utilize resources like ACE Fitness' exercise library and the CDC's workout videos for tips on form and technique. Another good idea is working with a certified trainer to help familiarize yourself with the gym layout and draft a workout plan.</p>
<h5>
5. Eat Up</h5>
<p>

Working out won't yield results if your diet isn't in check, too. Replace unhealthy foods with healthy alternatives and try to cut back on sugar. A good place to start is following the USDA's recommendation of filling at least half of your plate with fruits and vegetables.

It's a good idea to prepare before (and refuel after) every workout with high-protein snacks like nuts, yogurt, deli meat, hummus and cottage cheese. Of course, maintaining a balanced diet will help you meet your fitness goals, but it's also realistic to enjoy an indulgence here and there!</p>

<h5>
6. Be Realistic
</h5>
<p>
Losing weight, gaining strength, boosting endurance and increasing flexibility are all long-term goals â€” so don't expect to reach ultimate strength in a single week. Be realistic about the goals you set for yourself. For example, see if you can add five more pounds to your shoulder press or shave ten seconds off of your mile time within a month.</p>
<h5>
7. Rest and Repeat</h5>
<p>
Even the most experienced athletes appreciate the importance of rest after a hard workout. Try to get eight hours of sleep every night, take at least one rest day a week and always walk into the gym ready to repeat another solid workout. Once you get into a routine, you'll graduate from your "beginner" status in no time.

As always, please consult with a physician prior to beginning any exercise program. See full medical disclaimer here.</p>
